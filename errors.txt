1.hijacked error 
solution:delete .json files from build/contracts(shift delete them) and compile again (truffle migrate --reset)
2.In case of failue of truffle test remove the first line in code which appeared saying const { assert } = require('console');
3.In stacking check in test folder comment out first 2 lines of trnsferfrom function in Tether.sol and it works.
4.If truffle test is showing error for a particular function,make sure that the function is public.
5.After react connection if modules are missing,execute the following command
npm ci
This will fix all node modules in package-lock.json file.
6.If using MUI with the project,update the react version from 16 to the latest(at the time of writing is 18).Then install MUI if still error use command --force and install to solve the error.
7.After the command (truffle init) add the follwing line in truffle-config.js in the end before closing
(contracts_build_directory:'./src/contracts',)
this will help to read contracts from src folder itself as react cannot access components outside the src folder for security reasons
8.In react while coding the staking unstaking function,kepp in mind the 
(transactionHash)
is case sensitive
